# matplotlib-research-settings
A collection of settings used to make research publication quality images using matplotlib. 
All of these settings can be found in a "matplotlibrc" file.
Having it in this python script though makes it a bit more portable and easier for someone who doesn't have your matplotlibrc file to adjust .
To use, copy and paste the contents of "start.py" at the top of any Python script before a graph is made.
These settings assume the user has LaTeX installed.
